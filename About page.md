Hello, I'm Brennan, a software developer who loves building creative, technically challenging projects. I like pushing myself to learn new things and solve tough problems I come across while coding. I enjoy programming because it is like solving a complex puzzle with tight constraints; the satisfaction of solving it is what drives me. I mostly work on game development and developer tools for game development. However, I do love working on just about any project involving programming. I am a fast learner and can pick up new technologies and frameworks quickly. I especially work great in a collaborative environment with others that are passionate about programming and what they love to do.  

&nbsp;

In my free time, programming is one of my largest hobbies. I’m usually working on a side project, such as a mod for a game. I’m also big into gaming, participating in sports, and reading. My all-time favorite games are Minecraft, Fallout (any of them), and Just Cause 2. I run track and cross country, and I’ve recently started wrestling.

These are a few of the skills I have gained in my many years of programming. To see a further look past this simple list, take a look at my blog or portfolio:

- Soft Skills
	- Communication
		- I have done many collaborative projects in the past with other people enthusiastic about hobby programming. I have learned that communication is key to the success of those projects.
	- Leadership
		- I have led many collaborative projects online with people wanting to work on small indie games. Comfortable organizing contributors, setting milestones, and guiding creative direction.
	- Critical Thinking and Problem Solving
		- I start by analyzing the situation and then evaluating the potential fixes to the problems. I try my best to think outside the box and choose the best solution.
	- Adaptability and Fast Learning
		- I am comfortable learning and adapting to new tools, technologies, and workflows. Countless times in the past I have had to learn new skills for the success of a project. There have also been times where I am constantly between projects, working on multiple things at the same time.
	- Teamwork
		- I participate in many online group projects and support teammates where possible, especially during downtime.
	- Time Management
		- In high school I had a lot to do, taking college classes, sports, homework, and working on my coding projects. I quickly learned how to manage my time and still use those skills to this day.
	- Creativity and Curiosity
		- Love to come up with ideas for systems, break it down into smaller parts, and create it.
	- System Designing
		- Proficient at breaking apart complex systems into manageable components and assembling them together into a working system.
	- Optimizer
		- After creating a system, I focus on optimizing it and getting it working as fast as I can.
