Hello, I'm Brennan, a software developer who loves building creative, technically challenging projects. I like pushing myself to learn new things and solve tough problems I come across while coding. I enjoy programming because it is like solving a complex puzzle with tight constraints; the satisfaction of solving it is what drives me. I mostly work on game development and developer tools for game development. However, I do love working on just about any project involving programming. I am a fast learner and can pick up new technologies and frameworks quickly. I especially work great in a collaborative environment with others that are passionate about programming and what they love to do.

In my free time, programming is one of my largest hobbies. I’m usually working on a side project, such as a mod for a game. I’m also big into gaming, participating in sports, and reading. My all-time favorite games are Minecraft, Fallout (any of them), and Just Cause 2. I run track and cross country, and I’ve recently started wrestling.
