# My Portfolio Website

&nbsp;

Hello, and welcome to the first installment of my blog and dev diary series.

This one won’t have much cool stuff about my coding adventures just yet. Instead,
it’s more of an introduction to my website and the blog itself. For now, I’m just
planning to share cool updates and the coding rabbit holes I fall into. Might even
throw a curveball and post some real-life adventures too. I do want to set up a schedule
for this blog, and maybe even do videos alongside the posts, inspired by Sebastian Lague, but
I haven’t quite figured out what that schedule looks like yet.

&nbsp;

Originally, I made this website for a small side project I was working on: MMO Sudoku.
You can check it out in the Games dropdown at the top of the page. It's a fun game where
people from around the world can all play the same Sudoku board and work together to solve it.
I might add some cool stuff in the future like accounts, stats, and maybe even a competitive
gamemode with unique abilities. But for now, it’ll stay a small side project that I update every
now and then.

&nbsp;

While building that game, I ended up creating a React and TypeScript project and needed somewhere to host it. I decided to use GitHub Pages since it was free, but I also wanted a place to share a bit about me and the stuff I’m working on.

So this site came together alongside the game. I’m definitely not a web dev pro or anything, but with a bit of effort, some Googling, and Tailwind, I managed to throw together something I think looks pretty cool. There are probably still a few weird little quirks hiding around, but I’ll fix those up as I find them.

&nbsp;

In the next post, I might go over how MMO Sudoku works, or maybe even one of my past or current projects.
I’ve also been thinking about adding a comment section to the blog, maybe I’ll even do a post about building the blog itself.

&nbsp;

Thats about it for the first blog post.
